Alan Turing's seminal paper, "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," proposed a criterion for whether a machine can be considered intelligent. Known as the Turing Test, it suggests that if a machine can engage in a conversation with a human and convince the human that it is also a human, then it has achieved a form of artificial intelligence. This test became a foundational concept in the field of AI and sparked decades of research and debate about the nature of machine intelligence and consciousness. While no machine has definitively passed the test under its original criteria, the concept continues to serve as a philosophical and practical benchmark.

The Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence, organized by John McCarthy, is widely considered the birth of AI as an academic discipline. The workshop brought together key figures like Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon to discuss the possibility of creating machines that could simulate human intelligence. It was at this workshop that the term "artificial intelligence" was officially coined. Although it did not produce any major breakthroughs, it laid out the goals, challenges, and core ideas of AI for the next few decades, establishing a new field of scientific inquiry and setting the stage for future research.

In a historic event, IBM's chess-playing supercomputer, Deep Blue, defeated then-world champion Garry Kasparov in a six-game match. This was the first time a computer had beaten a reigning world champion under tournament conditions. While Deep Blue's victory was a triumph of brute-force calculation and specialized hardware, it was seen as a major milestone for AI. The match captivated the world and demonstrated the power of machine computation, inspiring a new wave of research in game theory and complex problem-solving. This event shifted the focus of AI research from symbolic reasoning to statistical and computational methods.

The iRobot Roomba, an autonomous robotic vacuum cleaner, was released to the consumer market in 2002. While it may seem like a simple device, it was a significant step in bringing AI into everyday life. The Roomba used a basic form of AI and sensor technology to navigate a room, clean floors, and avoid obstacles. Its success proved that AI-powered devices could perform practical, mundane tasks for consumers, moving the perception of robots from science fiction to a useful household appliance. The Roomba's popularity paved the way for a new generation of home robotics and smart devices.

IBM's supercomputer, Watson, competed against and defeated two of the most successful Jeopardy! champions, Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter. Watson's victory was a landmark achievement in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. Unlike Deep Blue, which was a specialized chess engine, Watson had to understand and respond to complex, often subtle, human language. The system's ability to analyze vast amounts of unstructured data in real-time demonstrated the potential of AI in fields like medicine, finance, and customer service, where understanding and processing natural language is critical.

Google's DeepMind developed AlphaGo, a computer program that defeated a professional human Go player, Fan Hui. The following year, it went on to defeat Lee Sedol, one of the world's top players. This was a major breakthrough because Go, with its vast number of possible moves, was long considered a game that required human intuition and creativity, making it a much harder challenge for AI than chess. AlphaGo's success, achieved through deep learning and reinforcement learning, showed that AI could master tasks that were previously thought to be uniquely human. It proved the power of these new learning techniques in tackling highly complex, strategic problems.

This demonstrated a new level of creativity and versatility in AI, making it a household name. Generative AI has since been applied to fields from art and design to software development and content creation, fundamentally changing how we interact with and use technology.
