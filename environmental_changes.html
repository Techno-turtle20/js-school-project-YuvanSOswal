Rachel Carson's book "Silent Spring" was published in 1962, documenting the devastating effects of pesticides, particularly DDT, on the environment and wildlife. The book's title referred to the disappearance of bird songs due to the widespread use of these chemicals. "Silent Spring" is credited with launching the modern environmental movement and leading to the nationwide ban on DDT in 1972. It brought public attention to the interconnectedness of ecosystems and the long-term consequences of human actions on the natural world, sparking a wave of environmental activism and policy changes.

The Cuyahoga River in Cleveland, Ohio, was so polluted with industrial waste that it caught fire on June 22, 1969. While not the first time the river had burned, this event received widespread national media attention, becoming a powerful symbol of environmental neglect and industrial pollution. The fire galvanized public support for environmental protection and played a significant role in the passage of the Clean Water Act and the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This incident served as a stark reminder of the urgent need for environmental regulation and corporate responsibility.

On April 22, 1970, the first Earth Day was celebrated in the United States. Inspired by the anti-war movement, millions of Americans took to the streets to protest environmental degradation. The event was a massive success, leading to the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the passage of landmark environmental laws, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Endangered Species Act. Earth Day is now celebrated globally as a reminder of the importance of protecting our planet, fostering a collective commitment to environmental stewardship and sustainable practices.

In Love Canal, a neighborhood in Niagara Falls, New York, residents discovered that their homes and schools were built on a former toxic waste dump. The buried chemical waste began to leak into basements and yards, causing serious health problems for the community. The resulting public outcry led to the creation of the Superfund Act in 1980, a federal program designed to clean up hazardous waste sites. Love Canal became a symbol of the dangers of improper waste disposal and a landmark case in environmental justice, highlighting the disproportionate impact of pollution on vulnerable communities and the need for stronger regulations.

The Bhopal disaster, which occurred on the night of December 2–3, 1984, was a chemical leak at the Union Carbide pesticide plant in Bhopal, India. Over 500,000 people were exposed to toxic methyl isocyanate gas, and thousands died. The disaster is considered one of the world's worst industrial catastrophes. It highlighted the devastating consequences of corporate negligence and the lack of safety regulations in developing countries. The event led to increased awareness of industrial hazards and the need for international safety standards, prompting new laws and regulations to prevent similar tragedies.

Adopted in 1987, it is one of the most successful international environmental agreements in history. The protocol has been instrumental in the recovery of the ozone layer, preventing millions of cases of skin cancer and cataracts. Its success demonstrated that global cooperation on environmental issues is possible and set a precedent for future climate action.

The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change adopted by 196 parties at the COP 21 in Paris. Its central aim is to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The agreement represents a historic commitment to combat climate change and adapt to its effects, with all countries submitting their own climate action plans (Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs) to achieve this global goal.
