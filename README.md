# Stage 1 – Task 1: Static Skeleton
Each topic page includes:
• Header with logo and theme toggle (static placeholder)
• Navigation container prepared for future filter options (currently placeholder content)
• Section with id “timeline” where event markers will be placed
• Empty modal container for future pop-ups (hidden by default)
• Semantic HTML tags like main, article, and figure for better structure
• Basic linking between pages for topic navigation


# Stage 2 – Task 2: Styling and Responsiveness
The design is implemented with CSS3, including:

# Layout
• Flexbox used for responsive horizontal timeline
• Breakpoints for mobile (below 768px), tablet (768px–1023px), and desktop (1024px and above)
• Timeline and header scale and rearrange based on screen size

# Styling
• Header styling with logo placement, theme toggle positioning, and navigation container layout
• Typography with clear, readable font for content and larger font sizes for titles and year labels
• Colour scheme with a clean, modern palette for backgrounds, text, and markers
• Event markers styled as circles or dots with labels for clarity
• Modal base styles hidden by default and positioned centrally with overlay background for future functionality
