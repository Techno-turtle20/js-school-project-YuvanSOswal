# Timeline App - JS School Project

## Project Overview
A fully interactive, responsive, and theme-switchable timeline application that displays historical, technological, and scientific events dynamically from a JSON file.

## Features
- Dynamic Data Loading â€“ All events are loaded from `timeline.json` for easy updates.
- Multiple Topics & Subtopics â€“ Switch between categories like Technology, Science, Art, etc.
- Interactive Timeline â€“ Click on any event to see full details in a modal popup.
- Dark/Light Theme Toggle â€“ Persistent theme preference saved in `localStorage`.
- Responsive Design â€“ Works across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- Animated Scrolling â€“ Timeline events fade in as you scroll.
- External Links â€“ Each event includes a "Learn More" link to Wikipedia.

## Project Structure
-index.html # Main HTML structure
-styles.css # Styling for light and dark themes

## ðŸ›  How It Works
- `script.js` fetches data from `timeline.json` and dynamically creates HTML elements.

- The theme toggle switches between predefined CSS variables for light/dark modes.
- Animations are handled with CSS transitions and JavaScript `IntersectionObserver`.

## ðŸŽ¨ Technologies Used
